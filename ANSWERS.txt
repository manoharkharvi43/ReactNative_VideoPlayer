# ReactNative_VideoPlayer
Video Player with React Native Expo .


1. My favourite state management library for react is Redux.
It's because in Redux , state is predictable and it is immutable.
It can be maintained easily , testing and debugging also becomes very simpler.

2. Some of the best React native practices are .
a)Function name should be relevant ,So that it increases code readability. 
b)Using Camel-Case for naming Convention.
c)Maintaining good file structure.

3. I would prefer DRY coding style because , code will be maintainable and easily understood by others who wil reuse that component.
Repeatation of code will be minimized.

4. It depends on the requirements and functionality that we want to implement in our app.But besides this, i would prefer Expo because,
Project setup will become very easy and much faster. It becomes very easy to test your code  ie, just by scaning QR code. Will face less 
version errors while runing the application.
